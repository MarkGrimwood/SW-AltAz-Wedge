# Equatorial Wedge for older Skywatcher Alt-Az mounts

This is a work in progress piece. There's a discussion thread with photos of current printed versions on Stargazer's Lounge https://stargazerslounge.com/topic/381427-experimental-3d-printed-equatorial-wedge-for-older-sw-synscan-mounts/

The code is for OpenSCad programmatic 3D design tool http://openscad.org/ 

Although I've been using OpenSCad for a couple of years I haven't really developed a programming style in it so the code is a little hacky in places unfortunately
